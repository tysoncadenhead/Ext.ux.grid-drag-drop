This EXTJS plugin allows you to easily create a two grids that can be dragged and dropped between.  The setup is fairly minimal because most of the work is happening behind the scenes.  There are actually only two required params - leftGrid (which is the grid on the left side) and rightGrid (which is the grid on the right side.) If you're curious about how to set it up, download the project and take a look at index.html which has an example of two basic array grids interacting with each other.
